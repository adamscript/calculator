# Calculator

In this project, I'm practising my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills by creating a calculator. Not proud of my code readability (which I'll probably fix later), but I learned a lot from this project and very proud of the result.

If you're on mobile, use the on-screen keypads. Or if you're on desktop, you can use either keyboard or on-screen keypads.

_p.s. It looks best on mobile._
